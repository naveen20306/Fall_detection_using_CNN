# For an 8-bit unsigned value 'u', the corresponding signed 8-bit value 's' is:
# if u <= 127: s = u
# if u >= 128: s = u - 256
# NumPy's astype(np.int8) on a uint8 array handles this conversion automatically.
# However, the common practice in CNNs is to center data around zero.
# This transformation maps:
#    0 (uint8) -> 0 - 128 = -128 (int8)
#  127 (uint8) -> 127 - 128 = -1 (int8)
#  128 (uint8) -> 128 - 128 = 0 (int8)
#  255 (uint8) -> 255 - 128 = 127 (int8)
# We use int16 temporarily to avoid overflow during the subtraction before casting to int8.
